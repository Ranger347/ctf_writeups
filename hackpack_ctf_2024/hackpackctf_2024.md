# HackPack CTF 2024

## Overview

I participated in HackPackCTF (4/14/2024) so here are some of my writeups. This year was very focused on LLM challenges so that was an interesting twist to the normal CTF scene. I am also in the CSC 405 class at NC State this semester so this CTF was a grade for me. Our team solved a total of 10 challenges, and we attempted most, if not all, of the challenges.

Some of the challenges my teammates did so there was no point in me trying to go back and do them again, but I will try to include some of their writeups as links in this document.
